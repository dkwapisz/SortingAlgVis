## General
This app shows how sorting algorithms work. At the moment, the program includes 6 different sorting methods, such as:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Shell Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort (doesn't work with sinusoidal numbers because of negative values)
To show how it works, it uses JavaFX's BarCharts.

## Features
- 6 different sorting algorithms
- 3 ways to generate numbers for sorting (just pseudo-random numbers, upside-down numbers, pseudo-random sinusoidal numbers)
- defining the size of the set to be sorted (recommended not more than 300)
- possibility to change the sorting speed (max speed on default)
- red and blue cursors that show which numbers are currently iterated  

## Technologies Used
- JavaFX 16
- Maven
- FXML (SceneBuilder)
